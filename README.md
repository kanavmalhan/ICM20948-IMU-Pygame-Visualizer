# ICM20948-IMU-Pygame-Visualizer
Uses an Arduino to receive information from ICM 20948 IMU and relays the information via a serial USB port to python where it displays a cube which mirrors the realtime movement of the IMU. 

Notes:

Make sure Python script (main.py) and serial port are on the same baud rate (115200 in this case)

Check that you have the correct serial port (Currently "COM9") update based on your serial port
